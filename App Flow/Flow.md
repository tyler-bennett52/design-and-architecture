# Application Flow

The purpose of this document is to envision how we guide customers through the process of giving us their money. Each blue block is meant to represent something changing on the User's device. This can be the entire page/view changing like navigating to a new URL, or it may be a pop-up (we will call them modals going forward) giving the user some instruction on how to proceed. The purpose of this exercise is to walk through what pages/views we want to exist so we can later design them in a wireframe. Below is my first take on this, just how I am envisioning this at the moment. I think it would be wise for you to start your own from scratch so you can really flesh out your vision but if you want a starting point [here](https://www.figma.com/file/3EQc8HhQGyPH6F9cZd75HG/Application-Flow?type=whiteboard&node-id=1-2&t=2gXUtKHX4pA3MfQJ-0) is the editable version. I should mention that the colors I chose are completely arbitrary and that this is an incredibly free from exercise.
