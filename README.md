## Wireframe

Wireframe is the most basic level design document. The below image is good represenation of one but they can even be lower fidelity. Basically just draw a box in the shape of your device (landscape for desktop, portrait for mobile). Inside of that box draw smaller boxes and label in 1-3 words what you want it to do (sign in, upload photo, etc.) and use placeholder text if you have a specific vision for something like the landing page or want to showcase a desired font. If you are looking for a placeholder text generator [lorem ipsum](https://loremipsum.io/generator/?n=5&t=w) is quite common and any developer will know right off the jump it's placeholder text.

This is done on a platform called Figma. If our extensive UI/UX team is not familiar with this platform I recommend getting comfortable with it as it is the de facto standard in the industry.

## Next Steps

With the wireframe in place the software team should have plenty to work with for initial buildout. Should be a natural next step for UI/UX to gradually fill in wireframe with more specific design elements (color, photos, etc.)

## High-Level Architecture

A brief overview of the tech stack required for a shippable product. Not at all comprehensive, but the options listed are mainstream and should not be controversial. This is the highest level view but this type of document can get much more granular and will be useful for communicating from technical to non-technical teams.
